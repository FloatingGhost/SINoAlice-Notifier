# SINoAlice event notifier

A notification extension for Firefox, compatible
with https://sinoalice.game-db.tw/timer

Game-db doesn't allow you to get notifications,
which makes using it a bit redundant.

## Installation

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/FloatingGhost/SINoAlice-Notifier/releases) and click on the XPI file of the most recent release.

Firefox will hate you for trying to install from github, but it's cool.

Now navigate to [game-db](https://sinoalice.game-db.tw/timer) - it should
prompt you to allow notifications. It'll probably just be a little
icon in the URL bar that shakes when you load the page.

Allow notifications, and then the extension will notify you when there's 5
minutes to go until an event.
